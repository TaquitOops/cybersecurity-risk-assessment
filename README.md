# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment: Commercial Bank Operations

## Project Overview
This repository contains a professional risk assessment performed for a commercial bank. The assessment follows the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, which is a voluntary framework consisting of standards and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

## Objective
The goal is to evaluate potential vulnerabilities, calculate risk scores, and prioritize security efforts to protect the bank's funds and customer data.

## Risk Calculation Methodology
Risks are calculated using the following formula:
**$Likelihood \times Severity = Priority$**

### Scoring Scales
* **Likelihood (1-3):** 1 (Rare), 2 (Likely), 3 (Certain).
* **Severity (1-3):** 1 (Low), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Catastrophic/High).
* **Priority (1-9):** A higher score indicates a more urgent risk to address.

## Key Findings
Through this assessment, we identified that **Business Email Compromise** and **Compromised User Databases** represent the highest priorities (Score: 6) due to the bank's operational environment and current vulnerabilities.
