# Executive Summary: Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
**Date:** December 2025  
**Subject:** NIST CSF Compliance & Risk Prioritization  
**Prepared for:** Bank Management & Stakeholders

## 1. Introduction
This report provides a high-level overview of the cybersecurity risk posture for our commercial banking operations. Following the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, we have identified and evaluated vulnerabilities to ensure the protection of customer data and the availability of funds.

## 2. Assessment Methodology
The assessment utilized a qualitative risk matrix where:
* **Likelihood:** Frequency of an event occurring (1-3).
* **Severity:** Potential impact on bank operations or reputation (1-3).
* **Risk Score:** Calculated as $Likelihood \times Severity$.

## 3. Key Findings
Our analysis identified five primary risks, with two requiring immediate mitigation:

| Risk Description | Priority Score | Status |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Business Email Compromise** | **6** | Critical |
| **Compromised User Database** | **6** | Critical |
| Financial Records Leak | 3 | Monitored |

### Primary Vulnerabilities:
* **Remote Work Surface:** With 20 remote employees, the risk of phishing and social engineering (BEC) is heightened.
* **Technical Debt:** Insufficient encryption on core user databases presents a high severity risk for data breaches.

## 4. Strategic Recommendations
To align with NIST CSF "Protect" and "Identify" functions, we recommend the following:
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Immediate rollout for all remote and on-premise staff to mitigate BEC.
2. **Encryption Upgrade:** Implement AES-256 encryption for all customer databases.
3. **Disaster Recovery:** Update the Business Continuity Plan to address coastal-specific weather events (hurricanes).

## 5. Conclusion
While the bank operates in a low-crime physical area, the digital threat landscape remains high. By addressing the identified priority-6 risks, we can significantly reduce our exposure and maintain compliance with Federal Reserve requirements.
